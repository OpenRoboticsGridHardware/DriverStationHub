Raspberry Pi 4: Touchscreen Deactivation and Fullscreen URL Display
This project guides you through setting up a Raspberry Pi 4 to automatically disable the touchscreen and open a specified URL in fullscreen mode whenever the device boots. This setup is ideal for kiosk or display applications.

Prerequisites
A Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS installed.
A 7-inch display connected to the Raspberry Pi.
An active internet connection.
Steps
1. Set Up the Scripts
Create a directory on your Raspberry Pi to store your scripts. Navigate to this directory where you will place the necessary files.

2. Make the Scripts Executable
Ensure that the scripts you have placed in the directory are executable. This step is necessary to allow them to run without issues.

3. Run the Installation Script
Execute the installation script to install all required dependencies and set up the necessary environment variables. Once the script has run, your Raspberry Pi will be configured with everything it needs.

4. Set Up the Script to Run at Startup
To have the Raspberry Pi automatically execute the Python script at startup, you'll need to configure it to run on boot. There are two main methods:

Using the autostart file: This method is recommended if you're using the Raspberry Pi Desktop environment. You can add the script to the autostart file in the appropriate directory so that it runs when the desktop environment starts.

Using crontab: This method is suitable for all environments. By adding the script to crontab with the @reboot command, it will run every time the Raspberry Pi reboots.

5. Reboot the Raspberry Pi
After configuring the startup script, reboot your Raspberry Pi to test the setup. Upon reboot, the Raspberry Pi should automatically disable the touchscreen and open the specified URL in fullscreen mode.
